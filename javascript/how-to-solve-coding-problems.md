    Take col of numbers, find pairs that are equal to a given sum.

    - Find out the input vs. output
    - Clarifying questions to remove ambiguity, narrow down possible solutions

    - recognize naive / brute force answer, explain why that would not be the ideal approach.

    - think out loud. Get used to thinking out loud to explain your code and thought process.

    - First solution will not be the best, but express your first solution ready with ideas of how to refactor.

    - Practice testing your code on a white board. Use simple datasets as inputs and think / talk through how exactly each piece of data will operate within your function.
